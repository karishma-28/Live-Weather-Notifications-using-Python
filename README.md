# Live-Weather-Notifications-using-Python

We all check for weather updates, especially when we want to go outside. Wouldnâ€™t it be more comfortable to get the notifications rather than checking them ourselves? Yes! We will be building a Python project that sends live weather reports as desktop notifications.

What is a Live Weather Desktop Notification Project?

This weather desktop notification project sends the live weather report of the location that you enter as a desktop notification. The information sent includes temperature, pressure, humidity, and description if any.

Live Weather Desktop Notification Project using Python

We will be building this project using the modules Tkinter, time, requests, and plyer. We build the GUI to take the input of location using the Tkinter module. Also, we use the requests module to extract the weather information from a website. The time and plyer modules are used to send the notification and let it pop up for a certain amount of time.
